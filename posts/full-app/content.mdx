# Create a Hello World REST API

start by creating your project directory and navigating into it:

```sh
mkdir my-backend-api
cd my-backend-api
mkdir src
mkdir dist
``` 

Initialize a new Node.js project:

```sh
npm init -y
```

Install TypeScript , type definitions and [tsx](https://tsx.is/#typescript-execute-tsx) all as development with the `-D` flag
install express as a project dependency

```sh
npm install typescript @types/node @types/express tsx -D
npm install express
```

Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project:
you can do this by running the following command:

```sh
npx tsc --init 
```

Open the `tsconfig.json` file and update the following settings:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
  }
}
```

Create a new file `src/index.ts` and add the following code:

```ts
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

Compile the TypeScript code and run the server:

```sh
npx tsc
node dist/index.js
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see the message `Hello World!` displayed on the screen.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a simple REST API using TypeScript and Express.

Now we're going to set up a way to automatically compile and run our code every time you save a file. 
This will save you time and make your development process more efficient. For this we we'll use the `tsx` package we installed.

Let's add  3 new script to your `package.json` file: 

- **dev**: This script will use the `tsx` command to watch for changes in the `src/index.ts` file and automatically compile and run the code every time you save a file.
- **build**: This script will use the `tsc` command to compile the TypeScript code.
- **start**: This script will use the `node` command to run the compiled code in the `dist/index.js` file.

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "tsx --watch src/index.ts",
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  },
```

# Version Control with Git & Gitignore

Initialize a new git repository in your project directory:

```sh
git init
```

Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your project and add the following entries:

```sh
node_modules
dist
``` 

Add all files to the staging area and commit them:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
``` 

# Containerize your API

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project, and add the following code:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

This will use Node 20, set up the working directory, copy the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files, install the dependencies, copy the rest of the files, expose port 3000, and run the `start` script.

1. Build and Run the Docker Image

Build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t my-backend-api .
```

Run the Docker container:

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-backend-api
```

Now you can access your API at `http://localhost:3000`.


# Setting up Live reload inside Docker

To enable live reload inside the Docker container, you need to mount the source code directory as a volume in the container. This will allow the container to watch for changes in the source code and automatically reload the server**.**

let's start by creating a `compose.yaml` file in the root of your project:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  my-backend-api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
    command: npm run dev
```


This will build the Docker image, expose port 3000, mount the `src` directory as a volume, and run the `dev` script.

Run the Docker container using Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up
``` 

Now you can access your API at `http://localhost:3000` and make changes to the source code without restarting the server.

# Setup Linting, Formatting, Conventional Commits, and Pre-commit Hooks

Install the following packages as development dependencies:

```sh
npm install eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier husky lint-staged @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional -D
```

Create an `.eslintrc.json` file in the root of your project and add the following code:

```json
{
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended", "prettier"],
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 12,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"],
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "error"
  }
}
```

Create a `.prettierrc` file in the root of your project and add the following code:

```json
{
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "all"
}
```

Create a `.lintstagedrc` file in the root of your project and add the following code:

```json
{
  "*.{js,ts}": [
    "eslint --fix",
    "prettier --write"
  ]
}
```

Create a `.huskyrc` file in the root of your project and add the following code:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "lint-staged",
    "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
  }
}
```

Create a `commitlint.config.js` file in the root of your project and add the following code:

```js
module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']};
```


Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .js,.ts",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "commit": "git-cz"
  },
```

# Setup Testing

# Setup API & Code Documentation
# Setup Continuous Integration and Deployment


Things you'll need to get started:
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express.js


Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:
